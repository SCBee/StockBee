# StockBee

This project is a WIP and is a stock screener developed in Python3. I started this project because I became interested in modeling market movements which seemed to be a great way for me to further practice and develop my data analytics skills.

I am normally a C/C++ developer but have used Python in the past to create simpler scripts for data wrangling (United Nations - World Health Org Data sets) and data visualization and this project has taught me the beauty of Python for scripting.

### Features List:
    1) Autonomous execution of script per market day end
    2) Filter tickers based on a variety of cases
    3) Group based on filters
    4) Consolidate into single Excel file for easy usage

Output: Multiple Excel files - n+1 files (one for each ticker analyzed and the single consolidated file)

Note: The purpose of grouping into filters is so that the user can manage different patterns easily and develop their trading strategies accordingly. It will streamline the charting process for retail traders and is a free, simpler alternative to paid services available online!
